# App-Profile-Data-Analysis

This is a data analyst project idea borrowed directly from
<a href="https://www.dataquest.io/projects/guided-project-a-profitable-app-profiles-for-the-app-store-and-google-play-markets-2/">dataquest.io</a>. Modifications have been made to project instructions.

The aim of the project is to analyse a Google Playstore apps dataset and propose an app profile to a fictional client. The client plans to develop a free app that will only generate revenue through ads, and therefore needs information on a profile that will ensure popularity and attract the most users.

The project has 2 constraints:

 a. the app must be free to use (i.e. non-paying; revenue can only be made from ads).

 b. the app must be for English language-speakers.
