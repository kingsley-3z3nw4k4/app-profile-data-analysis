# App-Profile-Data-Analysis

This is a data analyst project idea borrowed directly from
https://www.dataquest.io/projects/guided-project-a-profitable-app-profiles-for-the-app-store-and-google-play-markets-2/[dataquest.io].
Modifications have been made to project instructions.

The aim of the project is to analyse a Google Playstore apps dataset and propose an app profile for a fictional client who wishes to develop an app that will likely to attract the most users. The project has 2 constraints:

 a. the app must be free to use (i.e. non-paying; revenue can only be made from ads).

 b. the app must be for English language-speakers.
